Introducing "WPAP Studio" - Discover the World of Indonesian Geometric Pop Art!

Unleash your creativity and immerse yourself in the captivating world of WPAP, a Cubist-inspired style of geometric pop art that has been captivating the internet for decades. Originated in the late 1990s by the talented Indonesian artist Wedha Abdul Rasyid, Wedha's Pop Art Portraits (WPAP) have remained a timeless and relevant art form.

WPAP Studio proudly hails from Cirebon, the birthplace of WPAP and the hometown of its founder. As a member of the WPAP Community Chapter Cirebon since 2012, my mission is to share this original and vibrant art style with the world, showcasing the incredible talent of Indonesian artists, particularly those from Cirebon.
